## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Token is required"**
- Make sure you've added `POCKET_ALERT_TOKEN` to your repository secrets
- Verify the secret name matches exactly

**‚ùå "Application ID is required"**
- Get your application ID from Pocket Alert dashboard
- Make sure the application exists and you have access

**‚ùå "Failed to send notification"**
- Check your API token is valid
- Verify the application ID is correct
- Ensure your Pocket Alert account is active

**‚ùå "Device not found"**
- If using `device_id`, make sure the device exists
- Remove `device_id` to send to all devices

```yaml
- name: Send Notification
